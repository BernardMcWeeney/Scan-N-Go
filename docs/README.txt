All documentation goes in or under this directory.

All of your documentation should be placed in subdirectories of this directory.

Use the 1-proposal sub-directory for your project proposal.
Use the 2-midterm-docs sub-directory for your mid-term deliverable of documentation.
Use the 3-final-reports sub-directory for your final project documentation deliverables

There are additional instructions in each of those sub-directories.  Please read them.

** Excluding the proposal document, the general rule of thumb that you should
adopt is that documents should be converted to PDF when finalised - and
available for collection from your repo in time for the appropriate deadlines.

While templates are provided in MS Word format, individual students may select
whichever editing software they prefer - the only constraint is that
the final revision of these documents should be converted to PDF.**
