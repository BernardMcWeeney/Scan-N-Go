# SCAN-N-GO
### A retail solution to turn the customer into the cashier

SCAN-N-GO (SNG) is a disruptive mobile application and web service that will revolutionise the retail industry by turning the customer into the cashier. Our idea has the potential to eliminate all queuing and congestion in fast-paced retails stores globally. 
Our web application and infrastructure allows retail store customers to transform their smartphone into a product scanner and payment tool, eliminating the need for physical cashiers and even self-service checkouts.
